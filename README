              Catalina - Asynchronous Data Store for GObject
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING

  This library is LGPL-2 but it wraps Berkeley DB which has a very different
  license.  (Must be open-source to link against).  Therefore, if you link
  against this library you're code must also be open-source.  I do plan to
  migrate to a more relaxed data-base backend eventually, but BDB was quick
  to implement.
