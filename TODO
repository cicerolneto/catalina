TODO for Catalina 0.2.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

CatalinaStorage

    - Add custom indexes.
    - Add method for traversing key/value pairs and give ability to do it in
      parallel or serial.

    CatalinaStorage now has transactions, but its limited to a single
    transaction at a time for the entire object.  This is because its how
    TDB works.  Using Iris, we should be able to get around this simply by
    processing transactions serially.

    To do this, for each transaction we create a unique word-size and a short
    bit of state that can be kept within a hash-table.  In the state, we
    keep a linked list of IrisMessage's that are requests to alter the
    transaction.

    Upon transaction commit, the next pending transaction will be started
    and each message applied from within that transaction.
